The gaming room at Hutmachergasse 27 smelled of sugar and caffeine. Kokolores, Gantt and Photographer floated through the room and stared at the two screens that were occupied by Spasti. He sat tied to the gaming chair and his wide-open eyes oscillated between the crosshairs on the left screen and the map on the right.
Photographer opened the metal slats of the blinds just enough to peer through and saw Queen at the window. He couldn't take his eyes off her, couldn't forget the sight of her. He thought of Mona Lisa and diarrhea.
"I need energy," said Spasti. In order not to miss a second of the game, he left his hands tied to the keys so that Kokolores took care of his fueling and kept a black can to his lips.
"The Queen is four kills behind," said Spasti. "Can someone check her account?"
"She has 13,002 kills," said Gantt, looking at the Game Maker app on his smartphone. "Three more kills and she's back on Master Guardian I."
The photographer took a photo.
"Okay, I'll call the old woman," said Kokolores.

She used the door frame and railings to make her way into the living room. A vinyl record flew towards her, which she pushed away with a wave of her arm. Then a record player flew towards her. A snap and the box was maneuvered into the kitchen.
When she arrived in the living room, Kokolores started a video conference. For a brief moment, nothing could be heard except the shots from the gaming room. Queen answered the video call, the webcam taped over.
"What is it?!" Queen snapped. “Release Carlsstronaut.”

“Forget it!”

“We’ve already killed you a thousand times and we’ll do another thousand if you want to. You’ll soon be rid of your Guardian, so don’t mess around.”

“What?”

“Let me guess. A certain Spasti69 has been shooting you for two hours. You don’t stand a chance against him, you can bet your face on it. Spasti is having a seizure.”

“What did you say against my face?”

“Nothing. But I still don’t want to see you. You must be really ugly.”

“One more comment like that and I’ll cut the astronaut in half!”

“Go ahead and do it. Then we’ll just destroy your K/D. For good.”

“Are you really that stupid?”

“Huh?”
Queen hung up. Conference over.
Kokolores floated through the living room, surprised that her plan had no effect whatsoever.
"Queen is offline!", Spasti shouted through the house.
"She's leaving!", Gantt called after her.
Kokolores took a look through the window and was shocked to see that the satellite was breaking away from Hatter's Lane and hurtling into the blackness of space.
"After her!", she shouted. "Spasti, I need you in the basement at the engines."
With a jerk, Spasti pulled himself out of the straps of the chair and followed Kokolores into the basement. Photographer and Gantt stayed behind in the gaming room.

"Give me the photo," said Gantt. "Let's throw this away and forget about it, OK?"
"If I look like shit in the photo, I swear..."
"The photo is in the laundry room."
"All right," Gantt said. "You stay here and continue with the Queen. Don't do anything stupid, OK?"

Photographer rolled his eyes. Then, certain that he was alone in the room, he flicked a coin into the air. He forgot about weightlessness.

The coin bounced off the walls and flew through the door, hit the banister and continued on its way to the basement. Where conditions became more claustrophobic, the coin continued to rotate, bouncing off the second door on the left, forming shimmering outlines against the contrast of earth—earth!—past the only basement window until it hit the metal casing of an engine and it went ping!
"She's totally outpacing us!" said Spasti, spitting fire into the engines. "I can't keep up with that."
"Can't we throw off some ballast?" asked Kokolores.
"In zero gravity? Come on!"
From the ground floor, Photographer called: "The Queen is outpacing us! Can't you go faster down there?"
"Fuck, I'm out of breath," said Spasti. His fiery breath was nothing but a hot cloud of steam. That was a problem because Spasti's fiery breath was one of the last functioning engines in the house.
Oh boy, the problems were piling up. As Hatter's Alley moved further and further away from Earth, the Queen escaped our protagonists' reach and the pile of problems got another level when Kokolores dealt with her doubt that she would never in her life pose with Carlsstronaut-the-one-and-only. It was beautiful. Kokolores was beautiful.
No! She couldn't let that happen. She just had to get the boy to safety. Whatever the cost.
She set her sights on Spasti. He was panting a remnant of hot air into the combustion chambers, half bent over the engines, with tears in his eyes.
"I'll help you," said Kokolores. "Come up."
Spasti stood up. He looked Kokolores deep into her face, then he felt her tongue in his mouth. Her hands stroked his back, and he did the same. The two of them had a making out.
Kokolores pushed Spasti away. She felt something crawling out of her throat. It scratched, it blazed, it bubbled, it had to come out.
OUT!
Kokolores blew a cloud of fire through the room. A heat raged, so hot that it was NSFW, and Spasti also felt a fire rising within him. It was boiling on his palate and bubbling out of him. And he was horny.
Spastics and nonsense fired up the engines with redoubled enthusiasm.


The coin...
... floated out through the crack in the door and first hit the wooden paneling opposite the laundry room, then the door handle, the second hand, the water pipe, and then flew a hand's breadth above the tiled floor where Gantt was crawling on all fours. Washing machines were sailing around.
"Where is that?" he asked. "It has to be here somewhere."
What was he looking for?
"What?"
Hmm?
"Who was that?"
Who, where, what, how?
"What kind of psycho bullshit is that, man?! Get the fuck out of my head!"
Don't you find it funny - Gantt - you fruit of my intelligence - that you - whose voice I hear in my head - hear voices in your head?
"Get to the point, I have something to do here."
Gantt, you're a son of a bitch, a wanker, a pathetic piece of shit. And you play by your own rules.
“Everyone plays by their own rules here.”

I regret inventing you because it’s a lot of extra work to keep you in the story without you adding any value to the story. Your character is interchangeable.

“It’s your own fault! If you find me boring as a participant in your plot, you just have to spice me up a bit. Add a plot twist or something.”

Are you out of your mind? Do you think you can tell me how to do my job?

Gantt raised his right hand. It paused at face level, then slapped his cheek.

“Ouch!”

Stop hitting yourself.

A second slap followed.

“Ouch!”

Stop hitting yourself. Now, find your photo. I still have something to do with the president.

One narrative fizzled out. Then silence. Gantt was sure that he would no longer hear voices in his head for the time being, which gave him the chance to think about character motives. A coin floated before his eyes. He grabbed the coin and put it in his pocket.
