The astronaut could scream as much as he wanted. Up here, where the air was too thin to breathe, there was no one who could help him, let alone pay attention to him. Even Queen Culmingham Queen, who sat next to him and pressed this and that button on the dashboard, ignored him to the letter.
They occupied a satellite that had been expanded to include the functionality of a house. Clotheslines dangled in zero gravity next to the solar sails, and as far as their needs were concerned, a niche with a suction device had been set up next to the telescope. The propulsion technology not only drove the satellite around the earth, but also heated the kettle to boiling temperature.
"Oh dear," said the astronaut, and because his exclamation did not attract any attention, he added: "Oh dear... Oh dear, oh dear."
No reaction.
"OH MY!"
"Shut up, Carlsson," grumbled Queen.
Carlsson tried to free himself from the shackles on his hands and feet. Because the undertaking didn't give him a single millimeter of extra freedom of movement, he leaned back in his co-pilot's seat and sighed.

"If you only knew how many people are trying to get me right now," he muttered.

"What?"
"I have 17 million followers and everyone loves me. EXCEPT YOU!!!"
"Shut up. I'm just getting a little ransom from the president, and then hopefully we'll never see each other again."
"I'm being held captive by a dragon in the tower... If I tell my friends..."
Carlsson got a slap.
"I said shut up! I'll make a new announcement."
Queen opened the laptop and made sure that the webcam was covered with a sticker. She had learned from various films that the success of a hostage situation depends largely on the anonymity of the hostage takers. This suited her well, as she only revealed her appearance when absolutely necessary, so I won't go into superficialities and will point out that Queen - whatever she looked like - started a video conference to the White House.
She cleared her throat and gave Carlsson a venomous look. He was sweating.
The video call was answered. The President of the United States appeared on the laptop screen.
"Mr. President," Queen began. "This is my last message to you, and also my last. Give me 50 million Bitcoins and I'll let the Astronaut free. I'll give you 12 hours to send me the Money to my wallet. If no, I will drop the Astronaut out of the window, then you'll have a national hero falling from the sky. Not funny, right?"
The President didn't move. He stared past the camera with his alpine white face, and the fact that he was presenting his clown face in the delicate situation, with red hair and a red nose tip among other typical clown-face features, made Queen nervous. She hit the dashboard with her fist.
"Mr. McDonald!" she shouted. "Look at ze facts! Either you do a decision or I will do ze s for you."
The President fell from his chair. For a moment, Queen could see through the window of the Oval Office, the skyline of Washington D.C. in the panoramic window, through the laptop screen. A Secret Service employee scurried into the picture. He draped the President on his chair, waved at the camera and disappeared. To the amazement of everyone involved, despite the fall, there was not the slightest change in the President's face.
"You fuck!" screamed Queen. "Mr. President, I have very much respect for your chilly milly, but ze is not working here. 50 million, 12 hours, time is running." Queen ended the video conference and leaned back in her chair.
The beeping and flickering of the on-board electronics buzzed through the interior and reminded Queen of a school trip a long, long time ago. A camping trip into the forest, with hiking trips and campfires in the late hours, and Queen sat in a circle with her classmates and stared at the flames at her feet. She never belonged to a group, was always on her own and lonely from morning to old age, but she was part of a story and nothing else mattered. The crickets chirped through the forest.

It should be obvious that the President of the United States was actually the mascot of a well-known fast-food chain. In the form of a cardboard cutout.
How this could have happened was the subject of research by whole hosts of political scientists, but the answer was trivially simple: people lost the ability to distinguish between clowns and chimpanzees.

The election campaign was a one-man show by the clown candidate, because for some reason all of his competitors died during the campaign. Their corpses had ketchup on their ties, which in turn kept whole hosts of criminologists busy, but they were unable to shed any light on the gloom of the series of murders, because the ketchup turned out to be blood. As it developed, social obesity was enriched with a certain satirical drill.

The victory of the presidential candidacy was as predictable as the fizzing of a shaken Coke. And when the press spokesman for the fast-food chain in question announced to the cameras that the clown would follow his oath - for the benefit of the paying public - the coverage bubbled up its sugar paste all over the world. A few months later, journalism announced its own extinction, as no one could be found to spend money on coverage that revolved exclusively around the president's inaction.

"You're not really going to kill me, are you?" asked Carlsson.

"Depends on whether your president is interested in you," said Queen.

"I'm done for."

"Well, then I'll just throw you out of the satellite and you'll fly 35 kilometers down. Maybe you'll set a new world record as the first person to break the sound barrier in free fall while screaming for his mom. HAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"

Queen sucked on her e-cigarette. She pressed a game controller into the astronaut's bound hands and grabbed a second controller. They spent the next few hours doing quickscopes and respawns, followed by a dash of shit-talking because Queen broke off the left control stick.
