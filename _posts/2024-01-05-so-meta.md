Basically, we - you, as a reading individual, and I, as a writer - can now get to know Gulli, the fifth of the Fantastic Five. He is a withdrawn person, which explains why in the previous scenes he preferred to stay in his own room rather than chilling out with his friends on the veranda or roof. Since the autonomy of his room enjoys a sacred status, we have to knock.
*Knock knock*
"Hm?"
The author. The readers want to get to know you.
"Hmph."
Are you sure? For dramaturgy reasons, it would be advisable for the readers to be informed about the character events of the protagonists. This makes you more believable.
"Hmmmmm..."
Listen. Before you tailor a character into the plot, you have to explain how the character got into the plot and what his motives are. You have to explain his place in the story world before you let him into the story world. Otherwise, the character degenerates into some NPC who is only there to make the world seem less empty, and none of the readers, not even myself, know what role the NPC has in the story. Do you know what they call that?

"Hm?"
Gauntlet production. Just open the door for a minute, Gulli, so we can see you, OK?

"Mh-Mh."
Are you sure?

"Hm!"
Fine. If I get a bad review because of that, it's your fault.
