Meanwhile, in the laundry room. Photographer was nibbling on a clothespin as he removed the lint from the spacesuits, one by one, shook them out, folded them, and placed them on the dryer. Given his vise-like stature, this was a laborious task.

"Hey, take a picture of me!" someone said.

Photographer threw the author's train of thought out of his head and spun him around. Gantt stood at the threshold of the laundry room.

"Bad lighting," said Photographer.

"Funny you never say that to rubbish."

Gantt took a few steps toward Photographer. Although I am obligated to be objective as an author, I must note that the lighting in the laundry room was indeed terrible. There was something sinister about it.

"I want you to take a picture of me," said Gantt.
"This is going to be a bad photo."
"Then make sure it's not bad."
"I can't."
"No?"
"I don't have the Photoshop skills."
Gantt's eyebrows raised.

Fotographer mounted a camera on his head. He cranked the controls and looked at Gantt as if he was searching his face for treasure.
"Take a good photo or I'll kill you."
Gantt pulled out a gun and pointed it at Fotograf. "Go on! Make me beautiful!" he said. Then he spread his legs and put his left hand behind his head. With an expression that suggested either constipation or a failed orgasm, he stared into the camera while still pointing the gun at the lens. Combined with the terrible lighting in the laundry room, Fotograf's eyes revealed what was probably the sleaziest sight of his career. Furthermore, this image was enhanced with the detail that Gantt was a shit-stalker. A fair amount of image processing was required to retouch this monster in harmony with the beauty ideals of the time. Undoubtedly, there are people who never get to see the front of a camera.
How could Photographer take a portrait that met the requirements under these circumstances? His tripod was shaking.

"Keep your pants on," said Photographer. Gantt buttoned his pants again.

"Damn, I'm so hot!" he said.

What happened next is hard to put into words.
