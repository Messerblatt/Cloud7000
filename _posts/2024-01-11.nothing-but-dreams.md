In the White House.

"Sir! Mr. President, Sir!" the man from the Secret Service exclaimed.

"..." said the President.

"We don't have to pay 50 million. The astronaut is free!"

"..."

"Great job, Mr. President!"

"..."

"You are the best!"

"..."

The Secret Service employee gave the President a personal standing ovation, then took a lunch break in the coffee shop further back towards the city center. Over a latte-moccacino, he pondered the future and whether it would one day be possible to go on holiday above the clouds. A flying hotel, so to speak, with a rocking chair on the veranda. That way you could have a Cuba Libre and unwind, stare at national borders ten thousand meters above the earth, away from your boss, who always smelled of cheddar.

When his lunch break was over, he went back to the White House.

Daydreaming.

Nothing but daydreaming.
