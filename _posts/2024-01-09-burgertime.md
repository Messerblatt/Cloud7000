In the White House.
When the video conference with Queen Culmingham Queen came to an abrupt end, the President did not move heaven and earth to free Carlsson from the clutches of his hostage-taker. He did not call the Ministry of Defense. He did not call a press conference. He did not seek a second opinion, let alone a first one.
"Mr. President?" asked a Secret Service employee who was adjusting the device to his ear. "Two hours until deadline. What to do?"
The President remained in his chair and let the full range of his cardboardiness show on his face. A cheeseburger lay on the table in front of him, the so-called First Burger.
"Mr. President?"
When the President led his election campaign to victory, the press was seething with questions about his First Lady. Which lady would move into the White House with him? What was her name? What did she think of children? Did she have any?
"Mr. President!”
Such questions could be answered without much fuss, because the president — clearly made of cardboard and thus asexual — had neither a woman nor a man at his side. This was linked to the debate about sexual identity at the time, which was related to the fact that soldiers at the front were accused of being too heterosexual. The debate took on completely different forms and resulted in, among other things, additional chapters in psychology manuals and tolerance guidelines. Long story short: The president copulated with a cheeseburger.
The Secret Service employee pressed his headset and said:

“Damn, our president is sooo down to earth. I love it!”

Ketchup dripped over the edge of the meat pie.
