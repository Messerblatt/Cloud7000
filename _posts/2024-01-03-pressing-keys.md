"Ah!", called Photographer from the roof of the house. "The view is just nice! With the clouds below us, and just take a look at the sun."

He pointed to the sunset in front of his hinges. In view of the Mediterranean, he forgot that he had wanted to oil his third hinge weeks ago. By the way: Photographer has three legs, and they are all made of metal. His nature was limited to holding cameras, which means that as he developed as a photographer, he became more and more like a tripod. This meant that he could easily unfold himself on the roof of Hutmachergasse 27, but often tipped over to the side when he was near stubborn people, which is why the roof was his place of choice.

He blinked through the viewfinder of his camera. It went clickclickclickclickclickclick...

A machine gun salvo of sunset pictures shot onto his camera's 32GB SD card. It seems that the photographer was so lost in the viewfinder that we don't need to worry about the progress of his photo session.

Now let's take a look at the veranda.

"All right," said Gantt. "What's the plan?"

"We'll fly up there and steal the astronaut," said Kokolores. "It's easy." With her nail polish removed, she fiddled with the clip closure of a soft drink can. A look at the contents, a look at the horizon.

"Do we know where the satellite is?" asked Gantt, and Spasti added: "And how are we going to get into the satellite? It's got a padlock."

"Queen will let us in," said Kokolores, before trying to hide a burp with her hand.

"Boy, I'm scared," said Gantt. The cowardly bum always gave the impression of not having a hair on his balls due to his immaturity. 

"What about ammunition?" asked Spasti. "I'll give the Queen a headshot."

"Too dangerous," said Kokolores. "We'll talk her into something, but if we shoot around, the bullets will fly into our fuel tanks. No, wait! I have a better idea."

"Oh, really?"

"We'll take the old woman's business."

"Deathmatch?"

"Oh yeah."
"Heeheheehehe."

"The old woman can pack up."

"HEHEHEEHEHE!"

"Gantt! Turn on the computers in the gaming room. Photographer! Get the spacesuits out of the dryer, it's going to be spacey!"

Kokolores' delegation was gradually moving at Hutmachergasse 27. Preparations had to be made, because the Fantastic Five were about to embark on a rocket-powered ascent, comparable to the wormhole jumps seen in spaceships in science fiction films. The difference is in the objects that pass by the means of transport: when a spaceship moves at the speed of light, stars fly past the cockpit in the form of long lines, whereas the rocket launch of an apartment building is characterized by flocks of birds hitting the roof.

Kokolores, Spasti and Photographer entered the gaming room shortly before Gantt deleted the browser history. To feign calmness, he leaned back in his gaming chair and stared at the two 18-inch screens behind the keyboard while the rest of the crew gathered behind him.

They stared around thoughtfully. Nothing happened for five minutes. Finally, Spasti lost patience.

"Gantt!"
"Hm?"

"Now do something!"

"What?"

"We need the coordinates from the satellite. Look on Google or something."

Gantt typed something into the search bar. What followed was a deafening noise.

KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! 	KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! 	KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! 	KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! KLACK! 
  
The cause of this punching could be traced back to the new generation of gaming keyboards, which made every keystroke blare around with the volume of a pistol shot. Spasti was really into it. And everyone else had to endure it.

He confirmed with Enter (CLACK!) and the coordinates of the satellite he was looking for were promptly presented on both screens, rounded to the fifteenth decimal place. The search engines of the 21st century were the devil's work.

"We have the satellite," said Gantt.

"Nice," said Kokolores. "Photographer, why are you still standing around here? I told you, get the spacesuits!"

She forgot that her comment had triggered doubts and fears in Photographer, feelings that were related to the upcoming events. Photographer bolted into the laundry room.

Kokolores turned to Spasti.

"Spasti, why are you still standing around here? Take the coordinates and program that into the engines!"

She forgot that her remark had caused an erection in Spasti, a feeling that was related to Kokolores's belly clearance. Spasti retreated to the basement.

Gantt and Kokolores remained in the gaming room. The house rocked in the wind, the old building walls creaked and the ballpoint pen on the table rolled back every now and then.

"We're lucky," said Gantt. "The satellite is almost directly above us. We just have to tilt it a little."

"Do we want to tell Gulli?"

"Nope. He knew about the ascent before we did. I'll go do something in the kitchen, see you soon."

Gantt trotted out of the room and left Kokolores alone with her narrative.

She took her smartphone out of the fanny pack of her overalls. She checked her social networks. 744 new likes, 102 new subscribers, 222 new followers, 473 new comments. Her photos were commented on with declarations of love, teenagers asked her about the beauty products she used. They all wanted to be like Kokolores... Apart from the haters.

These were the photos of a photographer who had the talent to bring out the best side of Kokolores. The social networks devoured her beauty, because her appearance fit the concept of those networks so well that you would think she was embedded in the page as a CSS file.

Her ego became Wambo.

She typed Carlsstronaut-one-and-only into the search bar and sighed at the picture gallery.

Carlsson...

He posed with his spacesuit half pulled down. His hotness was off the scale. Plus his skin, his six-pack, his filters... She imagined them posing in photos together, their accounts merging. She imagined the envy she would feel from her fans if she did a joint social media thing with Carlsstronaut.

Her ego grew spikes.
