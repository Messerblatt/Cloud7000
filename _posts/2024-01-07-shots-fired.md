title: Shots Fired
---


"Shit!" said Carlsson. "We've been playing for two hours now and you're already five games ahead."

The screen showed the kill/damage ratios, ratios that indicated Carlsson's shooting game dyslexia and Queen's talent for headshots.

A new game was loading. The loading bar jerked from left to right, which Queen bridged with a look at the earth through the satellite round window.

The earth! Home of the people. It was destroyed on March 12, 2042, when a high-ranking Google employee plugged his USB stick into one of the company's own backbone servers and clicked "Continue without checking" in the pop-up window that followed. At the time of this story, the end of the world was still years in the future and deserved about as much attention as the competitions on the inside of beer bottle caps.

The loading time was over.

"Come on," said Queen. "One more game.”

"Nope!”, Astronaut replied. "I don't want to do any more!”

"And if I force you?”

"Then you'll get a beating from my followers. It won't be long now and I'll be out of here. Just wait.”

"You didn't hear the last shot.”

"Give me my phone. I'll do a crowdfunding campaign and scrape together the money myself.”

"Stupid idea, Carlsson.”

"Give me my phone.”

"Screw your phone.”

"I want my phone!”

"Shut up!”

"I want to take off my clothes!”

"Leave the spacesuit where it is. Nobody wants to see a slacker like you naked.”

"IF YOU KNEW!”

Carlsson shook his bonds. He shook himself in his chair, made the satellite wobble, and freaked out. "Mjarhkmmhhhwkrraaahhh!" he said.#

Queen ended his revolt with a single movement: the syringe hit a vein in his neck and released a substance into his bloodstream, which seconds later put him into a sedated state. Carlsson hung his head and did not make the slightest movement, with an occasional sigh as a signal that he was still alive.

Thoughts smeared through his brain, and a need to communicate overcame him.

"...Hnnn...queeeen?"

"Yeah?"

"NnggI'm afraid..."

Queen was silent.

"NnghI don't want that.... ... . .. Mhhhnnchhome... Mnto... home.nnnhh. On the roof... .just... on... the... roof... ."

Queen started a new multiplayer game. Amid the explosions of the grenades and the roar of the machine guns, Carlsson managed to utter one last word, a single word that went unheard because the war wasn't listening to him.

Carlsson drifted off into a dreamless sleep.

Even the collision with an approaching house couldn't wake him. That was exactly what happened next: a chimney scraped against the satellite solar sails. Hutmachergasse 27 was in front of the door.

Queen woke up with a start. She glanced through the window and saw first a doorbell sign pass by, then a cellar. She pressed pause.

Multiplayer games cannot be paused. Queen = miffed.

She grabbed the limited edition lightsaber and waited for the intruders at the entrance hatch. She kept an eye on her K/D by squinting at the screen in the command bridge. Someone wanted to ruin not only her hostage situation, but also her status as Master Guardian II.

The doors and windows of 27 Hatter Lane remained locked. The house clung to the side of the satellite and showed no signs of life, leaving Queen in a tight spot as she had to continue to wait at the airlock for intruders. Her avatar died and died. Her Master Guardian II crumbled.
